Thymes2 Framework
=================

Thymes2, or X2 for short, is a Java framework designed for back-end applications
that on one end are backed by persistent storage (a database), possibly
communicate with a range of other back-end services, and on the other end expose
a REST API. The framework is an alternative to several Java EE technologies,
primarily implementations of JAX-RS and JPA. It is modern, practical and
lightweight.
