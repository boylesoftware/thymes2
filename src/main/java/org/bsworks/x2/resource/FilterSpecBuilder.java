	 * The path starts at the class returned by
	 * {@link #getPersistentResourceClass()}. If the property at the end of the
	 * path is a nested object, the only filter types accepted are
	 * {@link FilterConditionType#EMPTY} and
	 * {@link FilterConditionType#NOT_EMPTY}. If the path contains multi-valued
	 * properties (collections and maps), the condition checks if the collection
	 * contains at least a single element that satisfies the condition, or, if
	 * negated, does not contain such element. Multiple conditions using the
	 * same collection within a single filter specification object are assumed
	 * to be for the same element in the collection. If the property at the end
	 * of the path is a reference, it can be suffixed with "/id" to use the
	 * referred resource record id as the value to test. Otherwise, the
	 * reference is treated as a nested object. The path may contain several
	 * intermediate references. If the property at the end of the path is a map,
	 * it can be suffixed with "/key" to use the element key as the value to
	 * test.
	 * @param type The condition type.
	 * @param negate {@code true} to negate the condition. Mostly useful if the
	 * property path contains collections.
	 * @param operands Operands, against which the condition tests the property
	 * value. {@link FilterConditionType#EMPTY} and
	 * {@link FilterConditionType#NOT_EMPTY} conditions do not take any
	 * operands. All other condition types require at least one operand. If more
	 * than one is specified, the condition test results are combined using
	 * logical disjunction ("OR"). The operand types must be either compatible
	 * with the property, or be instances of {@link String}, in which case
	 * {@link ResourcePropertyValueHandler#valueOf(String)} is used to convert
	 * the value. Operands, if specified, may not be {@code null}.
	 *
	 * @return This filter specification (for chaining).
	 *
	 * @throws InvalidSpecificationException If something is wrong with the
	 * condition specification.
