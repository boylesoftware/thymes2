/**
 * Aggregate property. The annotation is used to mark a transient property of a
 * persistent resource that contains result of aggregation of a collection
 * property of the same resource or a resource down the properties chain. The
 * value of the aggregated collection may be a nested object or a reference to
 * another resource or dependent resource. Immediate, simple single-valued
 * properties of the aggregated resource are used in an aggregation value
 * expression that is passed to the selected aggregated function.
 *
 * <p>An aggregate property is considered transient (not persistent) and does
 * never participate in any updates. When the resource record is loaded from the
 * persistent storage, aggregate properties are not calculated and are not
 * included unless explicitly requested in the provided properties fetch
 * specification.
 *
 * <p>The type of the property marked with this annotation may not be a
 * collection or a map. The type depends on the aggregate function and the type
 * of its parameter (that is types of the properties used for calculating the
 * aggregation). It should not be a primitive type to allow {@code null}, so
 * that it can be excluded from the resource serialized form passed over the API
 * when the aggregation is not requested.
